  - I am a programmer, Dont worry.
* Some useful quotes
  - "I do not carry such information in my mind since it is readily available in books. The value of a college education is not the learning of many facts but the training of the mind to think. - AE"
  - Kano Jigoro, the father of modern Judo, once told his students, “When I die, bury me in my white belt.” His wish was to be remembered as a student, not as a black belt master.
  - "Take the approach that you are always wrong, and your goal is to be less wrong". - Elon Musk
* On Programming
  - Everything software in the world is basically electronic circuitry + a bunch of 1s and 0s. Circuitry is easy, creating the 1s and 0s are infinetly more difficult.
  - Software is infintely more malleable when compared to hardware.
  - Programming can be simplified as an art of developing designs, paradigms, algorithms, languages, what not... All targeted towards controlling complexity.
